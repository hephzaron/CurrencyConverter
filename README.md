## Service Worker

This app makes use of a service worker that enables the app to download currencies, rates etc. and save to the browsers db. It also intercept requests to ensure user has an exciting experience when working offline.

> Conversion rates and historical data are only saved to indexedDb when a user at one time or the other have accessed the currency before. For currency list, it is independent of app usage.

## Indexed Db

This is the api used to store currency rates, history, lists etc. in various object stores on the browser, for a first time user get all currency list in the db might take some time due to the large volume of currency details been fetched from the network.

## Cache

This is mostly used to store in the cache  the app's page skeleton for a rich offline use experience.
